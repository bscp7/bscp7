### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Interview Preparation** and slow migration of repositories from bitbucket to github 💻
- 🌱 I’m expoloring gitops and Golang...
- 🎳 I’m looking to collaborate on Kubernetes best practices!
- 💬 Ask me about Docker, Cloud Native, CI/CD pipelines, DevOps/SRE best practices, Cloud Infrastructure, Cisco Networking...
